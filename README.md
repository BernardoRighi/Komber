# Komber

This application was developed during my undergraduate degree in Computer Engineering in 2019, in the subject of Programming for mobile devices.

# App description

Komber is an app for requesting fast, low-cost and reliable rides in just a few minutes, available 24 hours a day. All you have to do is tap on the Komber app to request a ride and soon a vehicle will be passing by to pick you up. Payment is quick and easy, by credit card or in cash.

This app is designed for people who don't have enough money to take Uber, but want the convenience of being able to get to their destination without having to rely on cabs or public transport.	

- It's simple, just open the app and enter your destination.
- The app uses your location so that the driver knows where to find you.
